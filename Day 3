Implemented a login activity for the user , where there are 3 type of users such as student , professor and admin.
initially the student login page was created where there are some set of details that has to be filled. 
first on the login page the user has to fill his/her user name or mail id and type their password and there is a drop down menu where the user need to choose the type of user he/she is i.e, student or professor or admin.
if there are new users then they have to register and then login .
if the user name and password along with the type of user he/she is correct then the next page will be displayed.
working on google firebase and its uses to maintain a database.
